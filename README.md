# titanic_problem

On April 15, 1912, Royal Mail Ship Titanic was a British Luxury ship which sank during its first voyage after colliding with an iceberg. Because of this 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew died. The reason which led to so many death was mentioned as not having so many lifeboats for the passengers and the most of  people who survived were women, children, and first class passengers.
This problem is a classification problem, because here the outcome will only be Survived or Not Survived in numerical values it will be 1 or 0.
Using Machine learning different models i am going to predict the survival.
